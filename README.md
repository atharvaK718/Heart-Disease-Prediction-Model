# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository houses a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on a set of input features. The model is developed using Python and leverages popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various health parameters of individuals, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The dataset used for training and testing is not provided in this repository, but you can obtain a suitable dataset from sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other reliable data sources.

## Model Development

The heart disease prediction model is constructed using a Jupyter Notebook (or a Python script). The development process involves the following key libraries and tools:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

The model follows the typical machine learning pipeline, encompassing data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation.

## Usage

To utilize the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed. You can employ a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

4. You can either employ the pre-trained model provided in the repository (if available) or train your own model using your dataset. If you opt for training a new model, ensure to modify the Jupyter Notebook or Python script as needed.

5. After training or obtaining a model, you can utilize it to make predictions on new data. You may need to adjust the prediction script or notebook to suit your specific use case.

6. Evaluate the model's performance by assessing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant indicators.
