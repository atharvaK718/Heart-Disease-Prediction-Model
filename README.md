# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Model

Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on a set of input features. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various health parameters of individuals, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The dataset used for training and testing is not included in this repository, but you can find a suitable dataset from sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other reliable data source.

Model Building
The heart disease prediction model is built using a Jupyter Notebook (or a Python script). The following key libraries and tools are used in the model development:

Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional)
The model goes through the typical machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation.

Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already. You can use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
You can either use the pre-trained model provided in the repository (if available) or train your own model using your dataset. If you're training a new model, make sure to modify the Jupyter Notebook or Python script accordingly.

After training or obtaining a model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. You may have to modify the prediction script or notebook as needed for your specific use case.

Evaluate the model's performance by checking accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics.
